# Python Code for Quantum Operations

To Use:

Step 1: Download each .py file.

Step 2: In latex_file.py, update the variable called directory_to_latex_file. This directory should point to a folder for storing a latex file. Note: In order to use this feature, one must have TeX installed as an application.

Step 3: Run latex_file.py in Spyder, an application for editing and running python files.

Step 4. Enter parameters as prompted in the console.

Step 5. Compile the latex file called main.tex, to see the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the Hubbard Hamiltonian matrix.
