# Python Code for Quantum Operations

To use this software:

Step 1: Install the following applications.

1) Spyder, an application for editing and running python files.
2) TeX, an application for compiling and viewing TeX files.

Step 2: Download each .py file.

Step 3: In latex_file.py, update the variable called directory_to_latex_file. This directory should point to a folder for storing a latex file. 

Step 4: Run latex_file.py in Spyder.

Step 5. Enter numerical parameters as prompted in the console.

Step 6. Compile the latex file called main.tex, to see the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the Hubbard Hamiltonian matrix.
